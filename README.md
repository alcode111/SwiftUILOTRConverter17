## Description

The Currency Exchange App is a SwiftUI application that allows users to perform currency exchange calculations between different currencies. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering amounts and selecting currencies, making it easy for users to convert currencies accurately.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion**: Users can enter an amount to convert and select the currencies they want to convert from and to.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The app dynamically updates the converted amount as the user types, providing instant feedback.
- **Currency Selection**: Users can select the currencies they want to convert from and to using a visually appealing interface.

## Stretch Goals

- **Support for Additional Currencies**: Add support for additional currencies beyond the existing ones to enhance flexibility for users.
- **Persistence**: Implement persistence to save the selected currencies even after the app is closed, improving user convenience.
- **Dismiss Decimal Pad**: Allow users to dismiss the decimal pad for better user experience and ease of use.
- **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to extract reusable subviews for currency selection in the content view, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
